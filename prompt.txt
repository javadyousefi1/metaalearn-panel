Create a clean Farsi UI for the “Create Course” form with the following updated logic:

1. paymentTypes (Multi-Select)

paymentTypes is now an array and user can select multiple payment types.

If the user selects option 2 = "قسطی", then additional installment fields must appear.

2. installmentType (Enum Select)

Show a dropdown for:

InstallmentType:
0 = None
1 = Auto
2 = Custom


Trigger the following rules:

If installmentType = 2 (Custom / سفارشی):

Show fields:

minimumInstallmentToPay (int, always visible in installment mode)

installmentCount (int)

A dynamic list for installments with exactly installmentCount items:

{
  step: number,
  amount: number,
  dueTime: datetime
}


The user must be able to add/edit/remove items.

If installmentType = 1 (Auto / خودکار):

Show:

minimumInstallmentToPay

installmentInterval (per day)

installmentCount

Auto mode means the system will calculate installment dueTime automatically.

If installmentType = 0 (None):

Hide all installment-related fields.

3. RequiresIdentityVerification

Add the boolean field requiresIdentityVerification to UI if it doesn't exist.

4. Keep Everything Clean

Keep spacing minimal

Align fields clearly

Use consistent layout with other form sections

Output labels & UI text in Farsi only

Avoid unnecessary elements
